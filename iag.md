# In-App-Guidance (IAG) Notes

## About IAG
- In Lightning Experience, add prompts and walkthroughs to your app to share information, train, or onboard users. 
- Write the content, select the **target audience**, and specify **where** it appears and for **how long**. 
- You can add multiple items to the same page, but they donâ€™t appear at the same time. 
- By default, a user sees only one item per 24 hours, per app. Salesforce shows it again, or cancels scheduled recurrences based on whether the user interacts with or ignores the prompt or walkthrough.
